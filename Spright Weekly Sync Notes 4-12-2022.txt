Spright Weekly Sync Notes 4-12-2022

- My last major project at the Tribe was the automation of a lengthy data assessment report using google APIs, 
python plots, and geopandas to insert charts, maps and text into a google doc in the cloud.  Able to investigate 
the possibilities for Spright Data reporting or future applications as needed.  
- Automated Routing: Process working great with:          
 SuitabilitySurface+Start/End Points => LeastCostPath => GeoJSON
 GeoJSON => add CARS data => Export to KML
 Able now to ingest .waypoints and convert to GeoJSON
 GeoJSON => .waypoints conversion by tomorrow.
- Learning more about PX4/dronecode Open Source Drone ecosystem.  Will be able to better understand how QGroundControl 
communicates with UAV via MAVLINK protocol.  Per Tyler it seems that many customers are using this ecosystem, and could 
facilitate flight planning that can be tailored to specific aircraft specs.
- Surface Generation/Routing Automation work could lay the groundwork for the operator/customer planning of routes on the fly, 
though still not sure how this might look and what the Ops role might be.
